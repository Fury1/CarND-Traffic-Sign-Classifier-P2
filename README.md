# CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-P2
The goal of this project was to build a CNN in TensorFlow to classify traffic sign images from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

Main steps covered in this lab are:

* Dataset exploration and visualization
* Data augmentation
* Deep network design and training
* Visualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions

Included in the repo is a Jupyter Notebook with the code, a writeup file explaining the project pipeline as well as some related examples.
