# Project 2 - Traffic Sign Classification
The goal of this project was to build a CNN in TensorFlow to classify traffic sign images from the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

Main steps covered in this lab are:

* Dataset exploration and visualization
* Data augmentation
* Deep network design and training
* Disualization of the certainty/uncertainty of the model's predictions

Please see the Jupyter Notebook for my submission.
